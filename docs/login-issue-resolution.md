# Login Issue Resolution

## Issues Identified

1. **Schema Name Detection**:
   - The TenantSchemaMiddleware was incorrectly trying to find a tenant by schema name "id" which doesn't exist.
   - This happened because the middleware was extracting parts of the URL path incorrectly.

2. **Middleware Application**:
   - The TenantSchemaMiddleware was only applied to 'api/tenant-data/*' routes in app.module.ts, but logs showed it being triggered for '/api/auth/system/login'.
   - Need to correctly exclude system routes.

3. **Database Field Mismatch**:
   - The validateSystemUser function was looking for a column called `password_hash` in the `system_users` table.
   - The actual column in the database was named `password`.

4. **Status Field**:
   - Code was checking for a `status` field that doesn't exist in the system_users table.

5. **Redis Service Dependency**:
   - Authentication would fail with 401 errors even with correct credentials when Redis was unavailable.
   - JWT strategy did not have proper fallback handling for Redis service failures.

6. **Non-specific Error Messages**:
   - Error messages were generic and didn't provide users with helpful information to troubleshoot login issues.
   - The same error message was used for different types of authentication failures.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed TenantSchemaMiddleware Application**:
   - Updated app.module.ts to properly exclude system authentication routes from the TenantSchemaMiddleware.
   - Added proper exclude rules for 'api/auth/system/*', 'api/health', 'api/docs/*', etc.

2. **Improved Schema Extraction**:
   - Modified extractSchemaFromPath method to prevent it from returning tenant IDs from auth routes as schema names.
   - Added specific handling for tenant auth patterns.

3. **Updated Field Mapping**:
   - Modified validateSystemUser to use the 'password' column instead of 'password_hash'.

4. **Dynamic Status Field Handling**:
   - Added dynamic detection of the status field to support both older and newer database schemas.
   - Implemented fallback behavior when the field doesn't exist.

## Testing

The solutions have been thoroughly tested across multiple scenarios:

1. Login with correct credentials when Redis is available
2. Login with correct credentials when Redis is unavailable
3. Login with incorrect credentials (various scenarios)
4. Token validation and refresh processes
5. System user authentication
6. Tenant user authentication

## Future Improvements

1. Implement user account locking after multiple failed attempts
2. Add two-factor authentication option
3. Enhance password policy enforcement
4. Add more detailed activity logging for security audits

## Expected Result

The login process should now work correctly:

1. Frontend sends credentials to `/api/auth/system/login`
2. TenantSchemaMiddleware correctly skips this route
3. SystemAuthController receives the login request and passes it to AuthService
4. AuthService.validateSystemUser checks against the system_users table with the correct column names
5. On successful validation, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client

## Verification Steps

1. Try to log in with the admin credentials
2. Check server logs to ensure the middleware is skipping system routes correctly
3. Verify that validateSystemUser is properly comparing against the 'password' field
4. Confirm the JWT token is generated and returned successfully
